# Kolmogorov-Smirnov Segmentation Algorithm

Implementation of a segmentation algorithm for time series based on the nonparametric statistic of Kolmogorov-Smirnov. A brief theoretical explanation can be found in the notebook, with an example of application. 

This implementation was done in the context of an undergraduate research project conducted at UFABC, with financial support provided by CNPq. More information about the method concerning its theoretical foundations, computational complexity and applications can be found in the literature.
